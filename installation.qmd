## What is R?

R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics.

## Installing R - Step 1

1.  Visit the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at <https://cran.r-project.org/>.

## Installing R - Step 2

2.  Choose your operating system (Windows, OS X, Linux).
3.  Click on "base" or the latest version.
4.  Download and install it.

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It makes it easier to write and manage your R code.

## Installing RStudio - Step 1

Visit <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> and click on the "Download" button under RStudio Desktop.

## Installing RStudio - Step 2

1.  Choose your operating system.
2.  Download and install it.

## What is Tidyverse?

Tidyverse is a collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy and grammar.

## Installing the Tidyverse Package

To install the tidyverse package, run the following command in the RStudio console:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```

## **Loading the Tidyverse Package**

After installation, you can load the tidyverse package with:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## **Introduction to R Tools**

R Tools is a collection of tools that integrates nicely with R and RStudio. It's essential for developing packages and includes tools like gcc and make.

Please note that as of 2021, RTools has been superseded by RTools40 for R versions 4.0.0 and onwards. The install process is similar but you should consult the most up-to-date resources.

## Why RTools?

\- Needed if you plan to create your own R packages

\- Useful if you want to install a development version of a package hosted on GitHub

## Installing RTools - Step 1

Visit CRAN's RTools download page at <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>.

## Installing RTools - Step 2

1.  Download the appropriate RTools installer for your version of R. Check your R version by running \`R.version.string\` in your R console.
2.  Run the installer and follow the instructions. Make sure to check the box that says "Edit the system PATH".
3.  Restart RStudio so the changes take effect.

## Verifying RTools Installation

In RStudio, run the following command:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
Sys.which("make")
```

If RTools was installed correctly, it should show the path to the \`make\` executable.

## Using RTools

Now, you can use the \`install.packages()\` function to install packages from source or the \`devtools::install_github()\` function to install packages from GitHub.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# install.packages("package_name", type = "source")

# devtools::install_github("username/package_name")
```

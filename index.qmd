# **Welcome to Statistical Computing in R!**

Welcome to the **Statistical Computing in R! for Beginners to Intermediates** organised by the Sector for Biostatistics and Data Repository, National Institutes of Health, Malaysia

![](images/banner.png){fig-align="center"}

## **What is this workshop?**

This workshop lays the groundwork for addressing key practical aspects of programming and other essential computer skills needed for both research and implementation of statistical methods. The course offers an introduction to programming in R and the tidyverse, guidance on coding best practices, a primer on data visualization and data wrangling, as well as an exploration of both descriptive and inferential statistics using R. Additionally, the workshop also introduces the concept of regression analysis in R.

## **Getting started**

Have a look at the schedule below and download the necessary .qmd files for each session. While I have included solutions- it would be way more beneficial to attempt these yourself first. Lets try to maximise learning in the next two days.

If you are new to R, don't worry - start off with this [deck](http://vivekjason.com/StatsComputingR_sbdr2023/installation.html#/title-slide) to learn how to install the software and familiarise yourself with the environment.

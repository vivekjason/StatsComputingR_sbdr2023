### **Task 1: Descriptive statistics using `tidyverse`**

Question: Compute the summary statistics (count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) of age using tidyverse functions.

Steps:

1.  Install and load the tidyverse package.

2.  Filter the dataset to remove missing values in the "age" column (Note there are no missing values in the dataset- the task is simply meant to simulate the code that would be required if there were).

3.  Use the summary functions from `dplyr` to compute the required summary statistics. In this case- count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum

### **Task 2: Descriptive statistics using `gtsummary`**

Question: Create a descriptive statistics table for age, male, bid, and malaysian variables using gtsummary.

Steps:

1.  Install and load the `gtsummary` package.

2.  Create a subset of the data with the selected variables (Note: Select any five variables).

3.  Use the `tbl_summary()` function to compute and display the descriptive statistics.

4.  Stratify by any other selected variable.

### **Task 3: Inferential statistics using `rstatix`**

Question: Test if there is a significant difference in age between males and females using the t-test.

Steps:

1.  Install and load the `rstatix` package.

2.  Filter the dataset to remove missing values in the "age" and "male" columns.

3.  Recode the "male" variable to factor.

4.  Conduct a t-test to compare the means.

### **Task 4: Inferential statistics using `gtsummary`**

Question: Test if there is a significant difference in age between Malaysians and non-Malaysians using the t-test, and present the results in a table using gtsummary.

Steps:

1.  Recode the "malaysian" variable to factor (Tip: Use the factor function).

2.  Use the `tbl_summary()` function to present the results.

Solution:

### **Task 5: Correlations using `corrr`**

Question: Compute the correlation between age, male, bid, and malaysian variables, and represent it in a correlation plot (Note: The selection of categorical variables is by design- just to practice the selection and presentation)

Steps:

1.  Install and load the `corrr` package.

2.  Create a subset of the data with the selected variables.

3.  Compute the correlation matrix (Note: Try ?network_plot and see how this can be used)

![](/images/network_plot-1.png){fig-align="center"}

This would be the outcome if anything was highly correlated in our data.

### **Task 1: Univariate Linear Regression**

Question: Perform a univariate linear regression to predict "age" using the "male" variable.

Steps:

1.  Install and load the required packages: tidyverse and broom.

2.  Filter the dataset to remove missing values in the "age" and "male" columns.

3.  Fit a univariate linear regression model using the `lm()` function.

4.  Summarise the model using `tidy()` from the broom package.

### **Task 2: Multivariate Linear Regression**

Question: Perform a multivariate linear regression to predict "age" using the "male" and "malaysian" variables.

Steps:

1.  Filter the dataset to remove missing values in the relevant columns.

2.  Fit a multivariate linear regression model using the `lm()` function.

3.  Summarise the model using `gtsummary()`.

4.  Save the output as a document

### **Task 3: Univariate Logistic Regression**

Question: Perform a univariate logistic regression to predict "male" (binarize to 0 and 1) using the "age" variable.

Steps:

1.  Filter the dataset to remove missing values in the relevant columns.

2.  Fit a univariate logistic regression model using the `glm()` function, specifying the family as "binomial".

3.  Summarise the model using `tidy()`.

### **Task 4: Multivariate Logistic Regression**

Question: Perform a multivariate logistic regression to predict "male" using the "age" and "malaysian" variables.

Steps:

1.  Filter the dataset to remove missing values in the relevant columns.

2.  Fit a multivariate logistic regression model using the `glm()` function, specifying the family as "binomial".

3.  Summarise the model using `gtsummary()`.

4.  Save the output as a document

### **Task 5: Model Evaluation**

Question: Evaluate the logistic regression model from Task 4 using AUC-ROC.

Steps:

1.  Install and load the pROC package (Note: Upon up the documentation to figure out the nuts and bolts.)

2.  Use the predict() function to get the predicted probabilities from the logistic regression model.

3.  Use the roc() function to compute the AUC-ROC.
